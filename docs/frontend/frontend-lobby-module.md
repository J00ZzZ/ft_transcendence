## Overview

The lobby is at `/gamelobby` (`LudoLobby.tsx`), with a separate table/room screen at `/gamelobby/table` (`Lobby.tsx`). Players set up and start a game here. It has:

1. **Seat setup**: player count (2-4, read from the `?mode=` query param) and seat assignment (`you`, `player`, `bot`, or empty).
2. **Bot setup**: add or remove bots.
3. **Mode selection**: PvP (player versus player), PvE (player versus environment) or hotseat.
4. **Match creation**: `LudoLobby.tsx` lists the rooms the caller may enter (`GET /api/games/rooms`; each row carries `mySeat`, where `true` means "you hold a seat here, so this is a REJOIN row": including a room whose game already started, as long as your seat is still inside its 45 s grace window) and the games they are seated in (`GET /api/games/mine`), and joins them (`POST /api/match/join/:code`, `POST /api/game/:id/rejoin`) or creates a PvP (player versus player) invite (`POST /api/match/pvp/invite`); for local PvE/hotseat play it hands off to the table screen (`/gamelobby/table?mode=…`). The table screen (`Lobby.tsx`) is the one that calls `POST /api/match/create` with the exact `seatColors` and `botNames`, stores the returned `activeMatch` (gameId and engine token) in the store, then navigates to `/game`, where the Socket.IO connection starts.

> **Note:** The lobby communicates with the real backend. Creating a match returns engine credentials (`gameId`, `token`, `engineUrl`), which the Game page uses to connect through Socket.IO.

## Key Types / Interfaces

### Seat

```typescript
export type Seat =
  | { type: 'you' }
  | { type: 'bot'; name: string }
  | { type: 'player'; name: string }
  | { type: 'empty' }
```

### PlayerCount

```typescript
export type PlayerCount = 2 | 3 | 4
```

### BOT_POOL

```typescript
// From theme.ts
export const BOT_POOL = ['Siri', 'Alexa', 'Cortana']
```

Bot assistant names, shown as-is because they need no translation. Three is enough:
seat 0 is always you, so a 4-seat table holds at most 3 bots.

The chosen name is also the in-game label. `Lobby.tsx` sends the names as `botNames`,
the backend stores them on the seats as `displayName` (`bot-<color> (<assistant>)`), and
the engine hands them back in the game state, so the table screen and the game screen
agree. Detail: [backend-match-module.md](../backend/backend-match-module.md),
[frontend-game-module.md](frontend-game-module.md).

## Core Logic / Flow

### 1. Lobby Rendering

Sequence of steps when the lobby page loads.
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as App.tsx
    participant Lobby as LudoLobby.tsx
    participant Router as useRoute()
    participant Store as useApp()

    App->>Lobby: <LudoLobby /> (route /gamelobby)
    Lobby->>Router: useRoute() → { query }
    Lobby->>Store: useApp() → playerCount, seats, settings, user
    Lobby->>Lobby: Render mode/seat setup, bot controls, start button
```

**The seat roster shows an avatar on every occupied seat.** The host's own seat renders `UserAvatar` with
the store's `/me` facts, so it shows the uploaded photo when one exists and the generated avatar
otherwise. Each `type: 'player'` seat is a *local* hotseat pilot: it has no account, so it renders the
generated DiceBear avatar seeded from the name typed for it here (renaming the seat re-seeds the
avatar), and it issues no photo request at all. A `type: 'bot'` seat takes that same generated path,
seeded from the assistant name (`BOT_POOL`) this roster assigned it, which is the seed the arena and the
results invoice reuse. This is the lobby half of the same rule the game board follows; see
[avatar-system.md](../avatar-system.md) → 4. Game seats.

### 2. Start Game Flow

The lobby (`/gamelobby`) sets up the seats and then hands off to the table screen
(`/gamelobby/table`); the table screen creates the match.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Lobby as LudoLobby.tsx
    participant Table as Lobby.tsx (table)
    participant API as Backend
    participant Store as AppProvider
    participant Router as navigate

    User->>Lobby: Choose a mode / seats, click start
    Lobby->>Router: navigate('/gamelobby/table?mode=…&bots=…&local=…')
    Note over Lobby: Or join directly (POST /api/match/join/:code, POST /api/game/:id/rejoin, POST /api/match/pvp/invite)
    Table->>API: POST /api/match/create { mode, playerCount, botCount, seatColors, botNames }
    API-->>Table: { gameId, token, engineUrl, color, inviteCode? }
    Table->>Store: setActiveMatch({ gameId, token, color, mode, playerCount, inviteCode })
    Table->>Router: navigate('/game?gameId=…') → Game connects via Socket.IO
```

## Logic Paths Summary

### Lobby Render Path
```
<LudoLobby /> (/gamelobby)
  ├── useRoute() → query (mode preselect)
  ├── useApp() → playerCount, seats, settings, user
  ├── Render seat grid for seats[0..playerCount)
  │   ├── type = 'you' → host seat (account avatar: uploaded photo, else generated)
  │   ├── type = 'bot' → bot name + remove button + generated avatar (assistant-name seed)
  │   ├── type = 'player' → named local pilot seat + generated avatar seeded from the name
  │   └── type = 'empty' → "+ Add" card
  └── Render Start button (enabled when a valid setup is chosen)
```

### Match Creation Path
```
LudoLobby.tsx (/gamelobby)
  ├── Local setup → navigate('/gamelobby/table?mode=…&bots=…&local=…')
  ├── Create room → POST /api/match/pvp/invite
  │   └── Refused while GET /api/games/mine is non-empty (you are already seated somewhere)
  ├── Room row → room.mySeat → POST /api/game/:id/rejoin (REJOIN row, own seat)
  │              otherwise → POST /api/match/join/:code (JOIN row)
  ├── Invite-code box → a code matching one of your own row → rejoin
  │                     any other code → POST /api/match/join/:code
  └── Success → setActiveMatch(result) → navigate('/game?gameId=…')

Lobby.tsx (table, /gamelobby/table)
  ├── POST /api/match/create { mode, playerCount, botCount, seatColors, botNames }
  │   ├── Error (bad mode / bots in non-pve) → show message
  │   └── Success → setActiveMatch(result)
  └── navigate('/game?gameId=…') → Game connects via Socket.IO
```

### Seat Management Path
```
addBot(i)
  └── Find unused bot name from BOT_POOL → seats[i] = { type: 'bot', name }

removeBot(i) / removePlayer(i)
  └── seats[i] = { type: 'empty' }

addPlayer(i)
  └── seats[i] = { type: 'player', name }
```

## How Seat Colours Are Sent

For hotseat and PvE, the created game is exactly the occupied seats (the host is always seat 0 / blue, then each added local player or bot in seat order). `Lobby.tsx` therefore sends the **exact** `seatColors` list rather than a count. Without it, the engine's `playerCount`-based default fills the gaps again and brings back seats the user deliberately skipped.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `store.tsx` | `useApp` for mode, seats and game actions |
| `router.tsx` | `navigate('/game')` on start |
| `theme.ts` | `BOT_POOL` constant, inline styles |
| `components/UserAvatar.tsx` | Seat avatar: the host's uploaded photo when one exists, otherwise the generated DiceBear avatar seeded from the seat name (local hotseat pilots have no account, so they only ever get the generated one) |
