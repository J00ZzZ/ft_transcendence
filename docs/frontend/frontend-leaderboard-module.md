## Overview

The Leaderboard page (`/leaderboard`, full-screen) shows players in rank order. It has:

1. **Rankings table** — rank, player (avatar + username), rating, matches, win rate.
2. **Top-3 podium** — highlighted cards for the top three players.
3. **Current user highlight** — "you" badge on the logged-in user's row.
4. **Counts and states** — the total number of entries, plus loading and empty states.

> **Note:** The Leaderboard reads live data from the leaderboard API (Application Programming Interface) at `GET /api/leaderboard?mode=global&limit=50`; there is no mock data. Translated text comes from `locales/*`, under the `leaderboard` namespace.

## Core Logic / Flow

### Leaderboard Rendering

Sequence of steps when the leaderboard loads.
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Page as Leaderboard.tsx
    participant API as Backend

    Page->>API: fetch('/api/leaderboard?mode=global&limit=50', { credentials: 'include' })
    API-->>Page: { entries, total, myRank? }
    Page->>Page: Derive top-3 podium + table rows
    Page->>Page: Highlight current user (myRank)
```

## Logic Paths Summary

### Leaderboard Render Path
```
<Leaderboard />
  ├── GET /api/leaderboard?mode=global&limit=50
  │   ├── Success → render podium + table + you-badge
  │   └── Failure → render the empty state
  └── Render each row with its rank, rating and the "you" badge
```

| `store.tsx` | `useApp` for current user |
| `i18n.ts` | `useTranslation` (`leaderboard.*` keys) |
