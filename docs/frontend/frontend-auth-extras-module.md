## Overview

These pages handle the steps that happen after the password check:

1. **TwoFactor** (`/2fa`) — 6-digit code entry after password login or OAuth (Open Authorization), when two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled.
2. **ForgotPassword** (`/forgot-password`) — password reset step one: collect an email and request a reset link.
3. **ResetPassword** (`/reset-password`) — password reset step two: use the emailed token to set a new password.
4. **VerifyEmail** (`/verify-email`): landing page for the emailed verification link. Redeems the token and routes on the outcome.

All four are full-screen routes (no side rail) and are public, so no session is required.

## Pages

### TwoFactor (`/2fa`)

Reached with `?token=<pendingToken>` after password login or OAuth when the account has 2FA enabled.

- Shows a 6-digit code input (numeric, focused automatically).
- Calls `POST /api/auth/2fa/verify` with `pendingToken` and `code`.
- On success, navigates to `/home`.
- On failure, shows an error message.
- A **"Regenerate code"** button re-issues a fresh code for the same challenge via `POST /api/auth/2fa/resend` (the previous code is invalidated); the per-user cap is 3/hour, over which the route returns `429 AUTH_CODE_RESEND_LOCKED`.

**Route params:** the `token` query parameter holds the `pendingToken` from the login response.

### 2FA flow

```mermaid

    A["Login with password / OAuth"] --> B{"Account has 2FA enabled?"}
    B -- "No" --> C["Session created — go to /home"]
    B -- "Yes" --> D["Backend emails a 6-digit code"]
    D --> E["Redirect to /2fa?token=pendingToken"]
    E --> F["Enter code → POST /api/auth/2fa/verify"]
    F --> G{"Code correct?"}
    G -- "Yes" --> C
    G -- "No" --> H["Show error, retry"]
```


---

### ForgotPassword (`/forgot-password`)

Step one of password reset.

- Email input with validation.
- Calls `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` with the email.
- Always shows the same success message, so it never reveals whether an address is registered.
- On success, shows "check your inbox" confirmation with a link back to `/login`.


---
---


### ResetPassword (`/reset-password`)

Step two of password reset.

- Reached from the emailed link: `/reset-password#token=<resetToken>`. The token travels in the URL **fragment**, not the query string, so it is never sent to the server.
- New password + confirm password fields.
- Validates password against the same policy as signup (12+ chars, upper, lower, number, special).
- Calls `POST /api/auth/reset-password` with `token` and `password`.
- On success, navigates to `/login?reset=1`.
- If the fragment carries no `token`, shows an "invalid reset link" error.

**URL fragment:** the `token` fragment parameter holds the 64-character hexadecimal reset token from the email. The page reads it on the first render, strips it with `history.replaceState`, and then sends it in the body of `POST /api/auth/reset-password`.


---
---


### VerifyEmail (`/verify-email`)

Landing page for the emailed verification link: both the signup link and the email-change link point here.

- Reached from the emailed link: `/verify-email#token=<verifyToken>`. The token travels in the URL **fragment**, not the query string.
- Reads `window.location.hash` on the first render, then calls `history.replaceState` to strip the fragment *before* the request, so the token cannot stay in browser history or appear in a later navigation.
- Calls `POST /api/auth/verify-email` with the token in the **request body** (via the store's `verifyEmail` action). Fragments are never sent to the server, so the token cannot reach nginx's access or error log; the same property protects single-use tokens from mail clients that prefetch links.
- Routes on the returned `result`: `signup` → `/login?verified=1`, `change` → `/profile?emailChanged=1`, `conflict` → `/profile?error=email-taken`, `invalid` → `/login?error=invalid-verification-link`.
- If the fragment is missing (some clients strip them), shows the invalid-link notice with a link to `/login`.
- If the request itself fails, the token was **not** consumed: the page keeps it in memory and offers **Try again**, instead of sending the user back to their inbox.
- A `useRef` guard keeps the redemption from running twice: React `StrictMode` double-invokes effects in development, and a second `POST` would come back `invalid` and race the first navigation.

**Route params:** the `token` **fragment** holds the 64-character hexadecimal verification token from the email. Note this page is also listed in `ACCOUNT_ACTION_ROUTES` (`src/App.tsx`) so that an already-signed-in user, the normal case for an email-change link, is not bounced to `/home` by the route guard.

### Email verification flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Signup, or a profile email change"] --> B["Backend emails /verify-email#token=..."]
    B --> C["VerifyEmail page reads the fragment"]
    C --> D["history.replaceState strips the fragment"]
    D --> E["POST /api/auth/verify-email: token in the body"]
    E --> F{"result"}
    F -- "signup" --> G["/login?verified=1"]
    F -- "change" --> H["/profile?emailChanged=1"]
    F -- "conflict" --> I["/profile?error=email-taken"]
    F -- "invalid" --> J["/login?error=invalid-verification-link"]
```

## Password Policy

Both pages enforce the same policy as registration:

```typescript
// frontend/src/validatePassword.ts — mirror of backend dto/password.rules.ts
const PASSWORD_MIN = 12;
const PASSWORD_MAX = 72;
const PASSWORD_REGEX = /^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[^A-Za-z0-9]).+$/;

export function passwordError(pw: string): string | null {
  if (pw.length < PASSWORD_MIN) return `Password must be at least ${PASSWORD_MIN} characters`;
  if (pw.length > PASSWORD_MAX) return `Password must be at most ${PASSWORD_MAX} characters`;
  if (!PASSWORD_REGEX.test(pw))
    return 'Password needs an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, a number, and a special character';
  return null;
}
```

## Page Notes

- **ForgotPassword** collects an email and asks the backend to send a reset link. The confirmation screen always appears: the backend never reveals whether the address is registered, and neither does the page.
- **ResetPassword** is reached from the emailed link, which carries the token in the URL fragment (`/reset-password#token=<resetToken>`). It validates the new password against the same policy as signup (`validatePassword.ts`); on success it sends the user to `/login`. Redeeming the link also marks the address as verified, so an account that had not verified yet can sign in afterwards.
- **TwoFactor** is reached in two ways, both with `?token=<pendingToken>`: from `Login.tsx` after the password step succeeds, or from the backend's OAuth callback after it emails the code.
