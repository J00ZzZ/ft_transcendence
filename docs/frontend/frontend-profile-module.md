## Overview

The Profile page (`/profile`) shows a user's public profile with statistics, recent match history and a friends panel. It is a full-screen route (rendered directly by the router); the page renders its own `RetroNavbar`.

1. **Profile header** — username, status indicator, avatar initials, rating and the date the account was created.
2. **Stats grid** — wins, losses, win rate, best streak.
3. **Recent matches** — each game with the other human players' names, the result (victory, defeat or draw), pieces in goal and the date. A game against bots lists only you.
4. **Friends panel** — friends with their online status and their rating; shown only on your own profile.
5. **Avatar actions (own profile)** — the `EDIT AVATAR`, `RESET` and `EDIT PROFILE` buttons, and below them a **message area with a fixed height**. The area shows upload and reset errors in red, and the photo-load warning (`profile.photoLoadError`) in amber. Because the height is fixed, a longer translation in Malay or French wraps onto more lines without moving the content below it.

When the page loads it reads the profile, game history, achievements, friends and leaderboard rank. It reads them again when the username changes or when the edit modal closes. It does **not** repeat on a timer.

## Core Logic / Flow

### Page Load

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App
    participant Profile as Profile.tsx
    participant API as Backend
    participant Store as useApp

    App->>Profile: Mount (full-screen route)
    Profile->>Profile: Read ?u= query or use logged-in user
    Profile->>API: GET /api/user/:username
    Profile->>API: GET /api/user/:username/games
    alt Own profile
        Profile->>API: GET /api/friends
    end
    API-->>Profile: profile, games, friends
    Profile->>Profile: Render stats, matches, friends sidebar
```

### Data Refresh

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Profile
    participant API

    Note over Profile,API: Read once on mount, and again when the username changes
    Profile->>API: GET /api/user/:username
    Profile->>API: GET /api/user/:username/games?limit=30
    alt Own profile
        Profile->>API: GET /api/friends
        Profile->>API: GET /api/achievements
        Profile->>API: GET /api/leaderboard?mode=global&limit=50
    end
    API-->>Profile: profile, games, friends, achievements, rank
    Profile->>Profile: Re-render with the data (no repeating timer)
```

## Achievements (own profile)

Your own profile renders the 13 achievements defined by `ACHIEVEMENTS_DEF` in `Profile.tsx`. The thresholds match the backend registry, which is the version that runs (see [backend-achievements-module.md](../backend/backend-achievements-module.md)). Match types are PvP (player versus player) and PvE (player versus environment, against bots).

| Key | Requirement |
|-----|-------------|
| `achFirstBlood` | 1 win (PvP or PvE) |
| `achOnFire` | `User.winStreak` >= 2 |
| `achDiceMaster` | 3 wins |
| `achBabySteps` | 1 bot win |
| `achTheDiceLoveMe` | 3 bot wins |
| `achTactician` | 5 wins |
| `achMaster` | 8 wins |
| `achGrandBotMaster` | 12 wins |
| `achWorldChampion` | 15 wins |
| `achft_Transcendence` | 10 PvP wins (PvE never counts) |
| `achLoveTheMachine` | 3 consecutive PvE games, any outcome (a PvP game resets it) |
| `achSpeedDemon` | win in under 30 minutes (unknown duration means no unlock) |
| `achUnstoppable` | 3 captures in a single game |

Hotseat games never count towards any achievement. The badge/tab counter shows `unlocked / 13`.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `store.tsx` | `useApp()` for `user` and navigation |
| `router.tsx` | `useRoute()` to read the `?u=` query parameter |
| `theme.ts` | `STATUS_STYLE`, `card`, `avatarBlue`, `goldText` |
| `api.ts` | `translateErrorCode()`, which turns an error code from a `fetch` response into text in the user's language |
| `components/UserAvatar.tsx` | Renders the avatar; `onPhotoError` runs when a photo fails to load |
